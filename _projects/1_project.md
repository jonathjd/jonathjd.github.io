    subcollections = collection_ref.list_documents()
    client_list = []
    # Create pandas df to export as csv
    df = pd.DataFrame()

    # fetch client ID's and append to dict
    for subcollection in subcollections:
        client_list.append(subcollection.id)

    for c in client_list:
        data = fetch_client_data(c)
        data["Client"] = c
        df = pd.concat([df, data], axis=0)

    df.index = range(0,len(df))

    return df
