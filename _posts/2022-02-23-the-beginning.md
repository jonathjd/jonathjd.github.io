## Introduction

Hey there! My name is Jon, and you're reading my first thought article. Like the name suggests, I named these as such because blog posts seem like they would be a little to much work. I wanted these to be a little more informal. Not quite stream of consciousness type writing, but not as rigid as a formal blog post.

I guess to begin, I should explain who I am, what this is, and why this is. Well, like I said, my name is Jon, and I am a Data Scientist working for a biotech company based in Washington State, USA. I started this site to be able to show case some cool projects I've been working on, as well as document my journey to my current position. I relied ***heavily*** on really helpful people along my journey to get where I am, only seems right to give back in this fashion.

I suspect that because this is my first post, it's going to be considerably bad. The formatting will likely be boring (I've used markdown before, but I'm not an expert) and I may draw on, but may as well start somewhere.
