## Introduction

Hey there! My name is Jon, and you're reading my first thought article. Like the name suggests, I named these as such because blog posts seem like they would be a little to much work. I wanted these to be a little more informal. Not quite stream of consciousness type writing, but not as rigid as a formal blog post.

I guess to begin, I should explain who I am, what this is, and why this is. Well, like I said, my name is Jon, and I am a Data Scientist working for a biotech company based in Washington State, USA. I started this site to be able to show case some cool projects I've been working on, as well as document my journey to my current position. I relied ***heavily*** on really helpful people along my journey to get where I am, only seems right to give back in this fashion.

I suspect that because this is my first post, it's going to be considerably bad. The formatting will likely be boring (I've used markdown before, but I'm not an expert) and I may draw on, but may as well start somewhere.

Fall of 2014 I began my academic career at the Unversity of California Irvine as a track and field athlete studying Biology. To be quite honest, I wanted nothing to do with Biology (at least at first) I wanted to be an Exercise Science major, but that was a specialization within Biology that you could only declare at the end of your 2nd year, so I just went with it. I had a **huge** culture shock my first year there. I didn't know how to study at all, was intimidated by all the brilliant minds surrounding me, and finished my first year by the skin of my teeth (2.6 GPA). Thankfully, that wake up call was what I needed, and I not only excelled my 2nd year but began to appreciate the life sciences.

I still went with an Exercise Science specialization, and eventually went into coaching like I had initially planned, but there were a few things that were bothering my while I started my journey as a coach-

1. Nepotism
    - I dont want to come off as complaining, but man, it was depressing knowing that landing a job was **extremely** dependent on who was on your resume.
2. Know-it-all Culture
    - There are definitely coaches who were critical, discerning, and adequately conveyed their level of understanding of certain topics. However, the modus operandi of most coaches is to make it seem like they have all the answers, which gets tiring after a while.
3. Infinite internships that lead to $12 an hour
    - Money isn't everything, I'll be the first to admit that. But while I was looking for my first job I had ~ 4 internships, a bachelors degree in Biology, and 4 years of collegiate athletics under my belt and was struggling to find a job that would pay me more than a $900 stipend per academic quarter (that is an actual quote).

P.S. I don't know how to remove the posts that came with this template when I forked this repo, and I kinda need the reference to the markdown files. So just roll with it for now. -Jon
