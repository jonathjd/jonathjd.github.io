I am going to embark on a 30 days of projects challenge where I try and complete a project every day and write a post about it. The projects can range from parsing scripts to plotting data to going over math topics. The first of such projects was on [file](https://jonathjd.github.io/blog/2024/parsing-fastq/) parsing!
