Hey! Welcome to my website. Per the name and web url, my name is Jon. I currently work as a Data Scientist- but enjoy software engineering, bioinformatics, and really all things data, science, and software.

I post my [thoughts](https://jonathjd.github.io/blog/) fairly often and about a wide range of topics. If you want to learn about my unconventional journey into industry, start [here](https://jonathjd.github.io/blog/2023/the-beginning/). Or maybe you're thinking about starting a bootcamp? Read about my $10k bootcamp experience [here](https://jonathjd.github.io/blog/2023/Pathrise/).

If you want to support some of my work. Feel free to buy me a coffee ☕️ using the link below.
