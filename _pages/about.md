Winter 2019 I graduated with my bachelors degree in Biological Sciences from UC Irvine. Spring of 2022 I graduated from Central Washington University with a master's degree in Human Physiology where I studied the transcriptome of aging human skeletal muscle.

Since then, I've learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a little bit about NoSQL databases such as Google Firestore. My interests lie at the intersection of human biology and computer science. I enjoy building web applications and dashboards to analyze high-throughput omics data to increase biomarker discorvery and drug development.
